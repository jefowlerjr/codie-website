        <div>
            <b>Committee Charge Statement:</b><br><br>

            The Maize Genetics Committee on Outreach, Diversity, Inclusion, and Education (CODIE) is charged with increasing the equitable representation of people based on race, gender, physical ability, sexual orientation, and any other attribute, within the Maize Genetics Cooperative and its leadership; within the area of Maize Genetics; and within the broader field of STEM education, research, and industry.<br><br>

            The Committee on Outreach, Diversity, Inclusion, and Education (CODIE) of the Maize Genetics Community is dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive community of researchers. To achieve this goal, the committee will specifically work on the following three objectives:
            <ol>
                <li>Improving the recruitment, retention, and recognition of scientists from underrepresented groups at different steps of their career;</li>
                <li>Broadening participation in the Maize Genetics Research Community, funded research and training opportunities, and in the Maize Genetics Meeting by international collaborators and U.S. scientists from research and educational institutions; and</li>
                <li>Encouraging Maize Research Community members to learn about the expression and negative effects of systemic racism and promote inclusivity and equity in science and education.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b>Membership &amp; Positions:</b>

            <h4>A. Membership:</h4>
            The Committee on Outreach, Diversity, Inclusion, and Education (CODIE) is made up of volunteers from the Maize Genetics Cooperative. CODIE terms start in June of each year, with the expectation that volunteers will serve two years, with the option to renew for another 1â€“2 years at the end of the term (with approval from the CODIE chair). The application process for CODIE membership will be conducted during the spring of each year with a call to all MGC members. A key goal of the process will be to maximize a diversity of perspectives on the Committee.

            <h4>B. Elected Positions in CODIE:</h4>
            There are two committee positions that are elected, in alternate years: the Chair, who runs the meetings of the full committee, directs activities with the chairs of the subcommittees, and reports activities and progress to the BoD and at the Maize Meetings; and the Secretary, who keeps the minutes of meetings of the full committee, confers with the Chair as necessary, and helps with communications (in conjunction with MaizeGDB). These two positions are elected from within CODIE and will serve terms of two years. The expectation is that the CODIE Chair would continue to serve as a member of CODIE for the year following the end of their term, to provide continuity and institutional memory for the incoming Chair. If there are no volunteers standing for election as the next Chair at the end of a Chair's term, then the current Secretary will assume the Chair position, with another election for Chair to take place the next year. In this situation, an early election for Secretary can be held.

            <h4>C. Non-elected positions in CODIE:</h4>
            There are six non-elected positions. The first three are Representatives from the MGC BOD, the MGM Steering Committee, and MaizeGDB (who will, in particular, help with technical issues); these three members will be selected by the groups they represent. The other three are Subcommittee chairs (the chairs of the Education and Training; Outreach and Accessibility; and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion subcommittees) and these positions are selected by consensus from within the subcommittee and by the chair.

            <h4>D. Subcommittee Structure in CODIE:</h4>
            Subcommittee members will come from community volunteers. Subcommittee structure can be revised by consensus of CODIE membership, based on existing tasks and initiatives. There will also be unofficial co-chairs of each sub-committee, which will be internally selected by consensus, with preference for newer members who will take over as chair after the current chair rolls off of their assignment.
